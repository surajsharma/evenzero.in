## [Match The Following](https://codepen.io/surajs1/pen/mYXeWJ)
A match-the-following game written in [p5js](https://p5js.org). Later at [Socratease](socratease.in), this evolved into a purely React-based project using Atlassian's [React-Beautiful-DnD](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd). A similar implementation of this turned into a Classification puzzle for [Socratease](socratease.co), here, instead of matching columns, the user must drag the choices into appropriate "buckets". Features included a randomized color-colding scheme which informs the user of the correct bucket. Click on images for respective demos/videos.
